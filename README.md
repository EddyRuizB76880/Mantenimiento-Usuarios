This small app is the result of doing the Exam#2 of the Mobile software development course, imparted at the Universidad de Costa Rica, during the second semester of 2022.

In this app, I implement:
- CRUD using DAO Rooms as persistent storage.
- API consumption by using the Volley library.
- A customized RecyclerView adapter for a RecyclerView UI element.
- Splash screen using LottieAnimationView.
- Model-View-Controller architecture.
